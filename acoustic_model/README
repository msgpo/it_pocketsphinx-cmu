This is Italian Voxforge acoustic model for CMUSphinx decoders -
pocketsphinx and sphinx4 version 5prealpha. It was trained with SphinxTrain.
The process of training is described in SphinxTrain tutorial.

This is 16kHz model, it works for high-quality recordings. It is not
going to work for telephone recordings, you need 8khz model then.

To setup the files use build.sh script from scripts folder as a base. It
should download required files from Voxforge, setup structure and
extract features. Scripts are located in scripts subfolder.

Testing is performed with pocketsphinx. Language model for testing is built
from test prompts with SRILM. Result of the testing should be similar to

TOTAL Words: 12575 Correct: 11570 Errors: 1104
TOTAL Percent correct = 92.01% Error = 8.78% Accuracy = 91.22%
TOTAL Insertions: 99 Deletions: 182 Substitutions: 823

If you need serious language model you can build it yourself from your texts
or from public corporas like Wikipedia dump.

To use this model with pocketsphinx, pocketsphinx-android and sphinx4
just provide it's location with -hmm pocketsphinx option. Also use the
dictionary with dict option. For more information see the tutorial.
